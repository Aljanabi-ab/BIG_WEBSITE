<h3>Responsive websites vs Mobile apps</h3>
<p>
Responsive websites are websites optimized for access on any device. The optimization is based on the screen layout and size of different devices. Therefore the web pages are designed to automatically take the layout of the device and optimize content to fit within the provided screen size (Groth). The page is also optimized for functionality and optimized user experience when using the device. These sites are normally hosted on a different subdomain from the main page and have domains beginning with m.domainname.com</p>

<p>Mobile apps on the other hand are apps specifically designed for mobile devices to achieve the desired user functionality. The mobile app is tailored to specific mobile operating systems and are availed in the official stores of the specific operating system selected</p>
<p>Both strategies to achieve responsiveness and optimization on different platforms come about with different advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>For instance, responsive websites are easier to create therefore development time is shortened. The cost is also quite lower than that of development of mobile apps (Anjos). Nevertheless, user experience does not match up to what users might prefer. On the other hand, mobile apps create advantages such as improved functionality, enhanced customization and improved user experiences based on the speed of responsiveness and ease of use (Bandi). The disadvantages of mobile applications is that they are slightly complex to develop, take a lot of time and are quite costly. Therefore, if the client does not have an experienced development team it may take a longer time and one may require to hire additional experienced developers.</p>
<p>The selection of the best strategy depends on the client’s strategy, timelines, and their content as well and use case scenarios. The end use of the platform critically defines the best option for selection. Cost and Timelines should not be the ultimate considerations of selecting the best strategy. The client/business should thus conduct market research and inquire user preferences for intended service to be provided as user satisfaction is the ultimate guide.
