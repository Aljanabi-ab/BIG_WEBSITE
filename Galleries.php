<h3>Best jquery sliders</h3>
<p>
JQuery is a Javascript library that simplifies the work of developers by summarizing several lines of code from JavaScript with a simple yet effective line of code to achieve different responsive functions on the web (Duckett). One of these functions is to improve the responsiveness of sliders in image galleries. A gallery is a collection of images in respect to a certain theme, event or scenario. The images are grouped as per what the gallery represents or the information intended to be passed by the gallery. The gallery has to be very interactive and implement a creative array of responsive features so as to attract the user into viewing all images in the gallery (Duckett). The user experience should not be complex in achieving tasks such as finding an image, viewing different sizes of the image, as well as a quick slideshow of the images. All these functions are easily achieved using JQuerry sliders.

One JQuerry slider is the ResponsiveSlides.js that is supported by a majority of web browsers. It also supports a variety of CSS styles and enables the developer to create a container slider of images. Slick is also another popular JQuerry slider that is fully open source. The slider is well known for its scaling capabilities and perusing functions whereby mouse pointer movements, clicks or arrow keys can be used to navigate the slider without much effort.

The FlexSlider2 is also another major slider that is supported by several browsers. The slider provides the capability of interactive transitions between images that are looped in a sequence. Such transitions include, fading, disintegration etc. The slider also provides a vertical and horizontal scaling function (Bidarra). Looping can also be optimized with respect to randomization and speed. This slider also supports call back Urls through its API integration feature.

The Swiper is also another interactive slider that is open source. The slider is mainly used for mobile use cases such as mobile apps, and mobile websites. The slider enables touch responsive transitions of images within galleries and is compatible with several mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android (Carlos).
